        <h2>Island Protector 2</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
            The game is similar to any Top Flight Shooter Games.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
            The game features arrow keys and space bar for actions. Space ships move according to their defined physics. 
            Ability to earn points when blowing up an enemy. Ability to die if one gets touched by a ship.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
            Messing around with the physics of the game. Trying to spawn in the boss accordingly without errors (still errors).
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
            Any Top Flight Shooter Games are similar, but this game is based off <a href="https://github.com/ansimuz/getting-started-with-phaser">Luis Zuno</a> game.
            </li>

            <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            Survive and shoot enemy ships in order to gain points.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
            Save the planet by surviving the oncoming wave (flight).
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            Shooting, moving around the map, suriving, and beating the game.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            To have fun shooting down alien ships, and try to survive.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            The player can use the arrow keys to move (UP | DOWN | LEFT | RIGHT) and use the SPACEBAR key to shoot enemies. They can collect power-ups that increase their amount of beams shooting.
            If they player collides with an enemy ship, they will blow up and begin to respawn.
            When respawning, no enemy can hit you.
            When you get hit, or an enemy gets hit from your bullets, an explosion animation goes off.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            Dodge and weave enemies coming at you. Blow them up when they're at a good distance to shoot. Collect the power ups in order to make the game easier.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Story</strong>
            After defending the first attack, in Island Protector 1, there's been alerts that another attack is incoming. 
            You are Alice, the last Cyber-punk pilot, you've been called again to defend the planet of Islands. Survive the two minutes of oncoming waves of enemies, 
            and be weary of the last couple of seconds of the game, as the secret enemy approaches.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            Anyone can play this game.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            Roughly 3 minutes.
            </li>
