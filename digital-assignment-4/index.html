<h2>Chicken Hunt</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Chicken Hunt is a game for skilled players who can achieve a high score if they know when to shoot.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The physics of the spinning player as well as the physics for the chickens riding along the fence.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned about rotational phycis, specifically how to manipulate how the character and hits shots all flow together.
Hardest part was making the physics for the chicken to follow around.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>All art is handmade by me using 'Paint 3D'</li>
		<li>All sounds are borrowed from <a href="https://www.freesfx.co.uk/sfx/cluck">freesfx</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2019/03/30/build-a-html5-game-like-mobile-smashing-hit-spinny-gun-with-no-physics-engines-using-phaser-3-and-paths/">Design on 3D rotation.</a></li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A spinner shooter where timing shots achieve for a high-score.

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Simple shooter by clicking. Rotational physics.
</li>

The goal was to achieve a shooter with 3D rotation.
</li>

Having fun killing chickens.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Click to shoot the chickens, pretty simple.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Timing the shots to hit the chickens.
